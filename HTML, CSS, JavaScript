internet: a network of networks: transmits data from one point to another
protocol: a set of conventions
TCP/IP: two often used protocols
IP = INTERNET PROTOCOL: unique address of the computer
DNS = DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (a service that translates the human-readable characters to the IP address)
TCP = TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL TCP includes mechanisms to solve many of the problems that arise 
      from packet-based messaging, such as lost packets, out of order packets, duplicate packets, 
      and corrupted packets (portions of data).
port number: an integer that represents a specific internet service requests (for example: 80 is HTTP)
data goes on different paths each time: a solution to over-loaded routers

quality of service = large packets are sliced into smaller ones, grouped together with other packets,
                     so everyone reaches the destination at the same rate
net neutrality = prioritizing data sent from certain companies, that pay more

the recipient should get the order of the packets right: a sequence number should be on each packet 
                                                         of data (also ensures to know if any packets get lost)
                                                         
HTTP: HYPER-TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL (means that contents of the packets are encypted): used for web browsers and web servers
has a few functions: GET (browser will request the information from the server) and POST
https://www.example.com/
s = secure version of http
DOMAIN NAME: example.com/ 
com = type domain name (meanings: com = commercial, edu = educational, org = organisation, net = network)
www = human convention to signify a web address (a visual clue)

https://www.example.com/index.html is the actual address that you are searching for: 
index.html is a name of the file you are requesting

STATUS CODES: 
200 OK: 'here is the data you requested'
301 Moved Permanently: 'whatever you requested was moved permanently to a different url'
404 Not Found: 'old url that no longer exists'

certain pages can redirect user (for example from http to https: for security)

browsers have developer tools to let you see what happens underneath the hood
everytime we open a web page: lots of photos and text (other media) open as well that are a part of the page

URL Parameters: url does support user input
search?q=cats 'search for cats'

HTML: mark-up language
