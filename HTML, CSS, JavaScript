internet: a network of networks: transmits data from one point to another
protocol: a set of conventions
TCP/IP: two often used protocols
IP = INTERNET PROTOCOL: unique address of the computer
DNS = DOMAIN NAME SYSTEM (a service that translates the human-readable characters to the IP address)
TCP = TRANSMISSION CONTROL PROTOCOL TCP includes mechanisms to solve many of the problems that arise 
      from packet-based messaging, such as lost packets, out of order packets, duplicate packets, 
      and corrupted packets (portions of data).
port number: an integer that represents a specific internet service requests (for example: 80 is HTTP)
data goes on different paths each time: a solution to over-loaded routers

quality of service = large packets are sliced into smaller ones, grouped together with other packets,
                     so everyone reaches the destination at the same rate
net neutrality = prioritizing data sent from certain companies, that pay more

the recipient should get the order of the packets right: a sequence number should be on each packet 
                                                         of data (also ensures to know if any packets get lost)
                                                         
HTTP: HYPER-TEXT TRANSFER PROTOCOL (means that contents of the packets are encypted): used for web browsers and web servers
has a few functions: GET (browser will request the information from the server) and POST
https://www.example.com/
s = secure version of http
DOMAIN NAME: example.com/ 
com = type domain name (meanings: com = commercial, edu = educational, org = organisation, net = network)
www = human convention to signify a web address (a visual clue)

https://www.example.com/index.html is the actual address that you are searching for: 
index.html is a name of the file you are requesting

STATUS CODES: 
200 OK: 'here is the data you requested'
301 Moved Permanently: 'whatever you requested was moved permanently to a different url'
404 Not Found: 'old url that no longer exists'

certain pages can redirect user (for example from http to https: for security)

browsers have developer tools to let you see what happens underneath the hood
everytime we open a web page: lots of photos and text (other media) open as well that are a part of the page

URL Parameters: url does support user input
search?q=cats 'search for cats'


HTML: hyper-text mark-up language (not a programming language, just tells the browser what to display and how)
html page will contain two elements: 
TAGS (elements)
ATTRIBUTES phrases that have special meaning (lang="en" clue to the browser that contents of the webpage are in English)


<!DOCTYPE html>  DOCUMENT

<html lang="en">  CONTENTS OF WEBPAGE (OPEN/START TAG)
    <head>  TAG
        <title>  TAG
            hello, title  RAW TEXT
        </title>
    </head>
    <body>  TAG
        hello, body
    </body>
</html>  CLOSED/END TAG

html is saved on server so others can reach it via internet
indenting isn't a must, but it makes the document readable


paragraphs.html <p> by inserting it between text it'll add paragraphs to it
copy/paste is usefull in html, as there are no loops


headings.html 
<h1>One<h1>
<h2>Two<h2>
...
by adding this in front of paragraph, we create subtitles/headings above each paragraph
bigger the number, lower the heading, but we can customise it

list.html 
<ul> = unordered list (not numbered)
<li> = list item (inside the list) creates a bulleted list
<ol> = ordered list (numbered list)

table.html <table>
           <tr> = table rows
           <td> = table data (data that we want inside the table)

image.html <img alt=" " src=" ">

link.html 
Visit <a href="https://www.harvard.edu">Harvard</a>. 
creates a link tag that connects the word with link
links are blue until you click them and afterwards turn purple

<style>
    
    a
    {
        color: #ff0000;
        text-decoration: none;
    }
    
    a:hover
    {
        text-decoration: underline;
    }

</style>
turns links into red colour without the underlyings, but when hovering over link, it underlines

# means an uniques identifier
we can also give each link a different id and then choose different colours for them

HTML FORM:
a form the action of which is to send user to the link they requested:
when an user types something into "q", browser converts that into corresponding http request and url

<form action="https://www.google.search" method="get">
    <input name="q" type="search">
    <input type="submit" value="Search">
</form>

method="post" = a different verb that hides the input of the user: 
it doesn't put it inside the url bar, rather to the server directly



CSS: Cascading Style Sheets: a style sheet language used for describing the 
presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.

<header style="font-size: large; text-align: center;">
instead of repeating "text-align: center;" over and over inside the <header style>, 
we can put it only once inside <body> and it will apply to everything inside the body

&#169 numeric code of html entity


instead of mixing CSS and html: we can use TYPE SELECTOR: 
when we want to style every tag, we can put inside the the {} properties of the CSS

<style> tag that goes to the head of the page

    header {
        font-size: large;
        text-alight: center;
    }
    
    main {
        font-size: medium;
        text-align: center;
    }
    
    
CLASS SELECTORS: 
<style>

    .centered
    {
        text-align: center;
    }
    
    .large
    {
        font-size: large;
    }
    
    .medium
    {
        font-size: medium;
    }

those are classes, but are not in use until we apply them to html tags
<header class="centered large">
<main class="centered medium">

an even better version is:
<body class="centered">
    <header class="large">
    <main class="medium">

if more people are collaborating: there can be two separate files 
and we can link the styles.css inside the html file
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
